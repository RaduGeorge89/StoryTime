The Starry Night Surprise:
On a clear night, a group of friends decided to have a spontaneous stargazing picnic in a nearby meadow.
As they lay on blankets, gazing at the stars, a meteor shower painted the sky with celestial wonders. 
Amid laughter and shared stories, a shooting star streaked across the heavens. Inspired, 
the friends made wishes that night. 
Little did they know, their wishes would intertwine, leading to unexpected adventures
and shared dreams coming true over the following year.
